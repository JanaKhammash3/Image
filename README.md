# Image Processing: Histogram Analysis and Contrast Enhancement

## Project Description

This project is a program designed to perform a series of image processing tasks on an input image. The primary objective is to demonstrate key image processing techniques, such as converting a color image to grayscale, visualizing the histogram, and enhancing the image's contrast using both manual and automatic methods.

### Functionalities:
1. **Read a Color Image:**  
   - The program reads an input color image (you can use any image of your choice, whether dark, bright, or low-contrast).

2. **Convert the Image to Grayscale:**  
   - The program converts the input color image into a grayscale version to analyze the intensity distribution.

3. **Show the Histogram of the Image:**  
   - It calculates and displays the histogram of the grayscale image, which represents the frequency of pixel intensities in the image.

4. **Print Features of the Histogram:**  
   - The program analyzes the histogram and prints key features/values that are useful to identify the shape of the histogram, such as peak intensity values, contrast, and distribution.

5. **Enhance the Contrast of the Image:**  
   - The program enhances the contrast of the grayscale image using the following techniques:
     - **Manually using Intensity Transformation Functions:** The program manually applies intensity transformations to adjust the contrast.
     - **Automatically using Histogram Equalization:** The program automatically enhances the contrast using histogram equalization, which adjusts the image's contrast based on its histogram.

6. **Compare the Resulting Images:**  
   - The program compares the images resulting from the two contrast enhancement techniques, allowing for a clear understanding of how each method affects the image.
